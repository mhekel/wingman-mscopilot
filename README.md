## üî• Wingman Deep Dive


This is the Microsoft CoPilot supercharged. (copilot.microsoft.com) - the one everyone claims is for "daily" personal and office tasks. Well, my personal office is all about coding/dev, graphic
design, troubleshooting, commandline tasks and more on both my Ubuntu Server laptop, Win11 laptop (with WSL). Since MS copilot is cross-platform by way of my microsoft account, it doesn't matter which computer I'm on OR wether I'm using the site thru a browser at copilot.microsoft.com  or the Windows App. 

Despite what all the docs say about MS Copilot not being for "code" or "dev" purposes, I can tell you that it's *PERFECT* for such things - especially since it's memory/history is saved (via my microsoft account) so copilot _knows_ me. 

I use vscode ALOT for almost all my dev projects. I want *my* copilot to be able to be *in* vscode-chat as an option because sometimes, there's too much code to cut n paste. 


## :bulb:	Learning

 What makes Wingman standout inside VSCode is the ability to "remember" chat history and learn *your* personality.
