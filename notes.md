🔁 Tried to install gh on Ubuntu. 
(source) 
``` bash
(type -p wget >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install wget -y)) \
	&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings \
        && out=$(mktemp) && wget -nv -O$out https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
        && cat $out | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null \
	&& sudo chmod go+r /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
	&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/sources.list.d \
	&& echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
	&& sudo apt update \
	&& sudo apt install gh -y
```
- First and formost- bash did not like the \ && so i did it line by line. 
- had to use ``` wget -qO - https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null```
-  getting denied as root/sudo sucks.
-  apt update didn't find the keyrings. *surprise*
-  skipped to ``install gh -y`` only to learn ```gh is already the latest version```

- It was already perfect. ```Wingman whispered: “Nice.” ```
